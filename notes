# Text Processing
1. Tokenization
2. Stop words removal
3. Stemming
4. Lemmatization

1. now what is tokenization
ans. Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into smaller units called tokens.
example: in the sentence "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", the tokens are "the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog".
advantages of tokenization: it is fast and simple.
disadvantages of tokenization: it may not always be accurate.and its removing the meaning of word.

2. now what is stop words removal
ans. Stop words removal is the process of removing the most common words in a language from a text.
example: in the sentence "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", the stop words are "the" and "over".
advantages of stop words removal: it is fast and simple.
disadvantages of stop words removal: it may not always be accurate.and its removing the meaning of word.

3. now what is stemming
ans. Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its base or root form.
example: in the sentence "running, runs, ran", the stem is "run".
advantages of stemming: it is fast and simple.
disadvantages of stemming: it may not always be accurate.and its removing the meaning of word.

4. now what is lemmatization
ans. Lemmatization is the process of reducing a word to its base or root form.
example: in the sentence "running, runs, ran", the lemma is "run".
advantages of lemmatization: it is fast and simple.
disadvantages of lemmatization: it may not always be accurate.and its removing the meaning of word.
